# PIC16B-HW3
 
This is a simple message bank project, which allows users to upload messages to a web page and view some random messages left by others, 
where the messages are storaged in a local sqlite database. The project is based on **flask** library in Python.

Go to my [blog post](https://yuanting.quarto.pub/homework/posts/HW3/) for more details.

Here are screenshots of the webpages it's going to render:

<br> Page for submitting messages.<br><br>

<a href="url"><img src="./readme_fig/view_page.png" align="center" width="550" ></a>
<br> Page for viewing random messages.<br><br>
